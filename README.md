Downloads songs from YouTube based on tracks found in a Spotify album or playlist URL.

This is my first Rust program. I originally cobbled together something in NodeJS, but found the size and performance to be extraordinarily undesirable. I used this as an excuse to better understand Rust and create something with the same funcionality, but smaller and faster. I can prove I have made the footprint smaller, but I am not confident that I have increased performance at all.

The original NodeJS can be found here: [https://github.com/ttrreevvoorr/ytdlspotjs](https://github.com/ttrreevvoorr/ytdlspotjs)


**While this does appear to be working, this is a work in progress**
